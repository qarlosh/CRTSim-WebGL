# CRTSim-WebGL
This is a port of [CRTSim](https://github.com/MinorKeyGames/CRTSim) to WebGL (GLSL ES).

The original project is done in C++, Direct3D9 and HLSL. This is a port
to Javascript and WebGL.

[three.js](https://threejs.org) is used for simplifying the code.

Many thanks to J. Kyle Pittman for the original CRT Simulation.
